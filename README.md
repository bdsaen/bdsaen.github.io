Welcome to my **Info Center** as I like to call it.

You could think of this as another blog site and maybe it is. I'd like to think of it as more than another blog site, but a location that contains not only blogs but other little tidbits of information that doesn't warrant the formality of a blog.

Over time this should contain the consolidation of cheatsheets and other documents I've created or collected over many years, recent problems I've encountered or things I've found, and anything else I've found that's useful.

Hopefully it can address some of the most frustrating parts of searching for solutions where many pose questions but end in silence, no solution to be found.

# Focus

The focus of this site will grow over time, but for now contains details surrounding IBM WebSphere Applicaiton Server, Open Liberty (or WebSphere Liberty) and IBM MQ.

Some topics may be indirectly related to these products, such as creating key stores and SSL certificates using openssl, ikeyman or keytool.

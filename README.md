This site is essentially my "info center" where I have documented things I have found or problems I have encountered in my day-to-day job.

It is a consolidation of my scattered files across multiple laptops and directories. I'm sure you know what I mean. It also contains the end result of many hours searching multiple threads on the internet, some useful and some not, and some frustratinly with no conclusion.

# Focus

The focus of this site will grow over time, but for now contains details surrounding IBM WebSphere Applicaiton Server, Open Liberty (or WebSphere Liberty) and IBM MQ.

Some topics may be indirectly related to these products, such as creating key stores and SSL certificates using openssl, ikeyman or keytool
